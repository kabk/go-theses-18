<p>Here’s some leads… You could start with journalists are up to… <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/" title="Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek - Multimedia Feature - NYTimes.com">Snow Fall</a> by the NYT has become something of a classic… They influenced a lot the whole long read genre… Als outside of journalism this has become a thing—Martijn showed this <a href="http://www.vpro.nl/zomergasten/gastenlijst/03-saskia-noort/" title="VPRO ZomerGastenlijst - Saskia Noort">rather baroque Dutch example</a>. I’m sure there are more exciting examples of digital reportage—did you come across them already?</p>

<p>But at the same time you are no journalists. You are art students. So what are art students up to these days? The students in the school of Valence create their own blog where they focus on the dialogue: <a href="http://from.esad-gv.fr/to/" title="From—To">From—To</a>. Students write to other students, teacher, guest teachers, sometimes to someone outside of the graphic design field. The subject always has to do with their thesis or their final exam project. Sometimes the addresees write back; this becomes its own post.<br/>
This is not the only platform the students have at their disposition, even if it is the one where the students have the most control. The school also publishes, in collaboration with publisher B42, extracts from student theses. These paper publication follow a more traditional editorial proces: <a href="http://editions-b42.com/books/txt/" title="ÉDITIONS B42 ♦● .TXT">txt</a>, <a href="http://editions-b42.com/books/txt-2/" title="ÉDITIONS B42 ♦● .TXT 2">txt #2</a>. It is interesting to imagine how these two modes of publishing work together. What possibilities do other schools offer for student publishing?</p>

<p>Of course when school is done graphic designers keep publishing. Designers today show a great love for the production and publishing of printed matter especially. Many a risograph printer is rescued from rusty sheds. But how does this enthousiasm for self-publishing translate to the web?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bat-editions.net/" title="BAT stands for Books, Art and Texts">BAT éditions</a> is an interesting example. They used to publish a really awesome magazine called <a href="http://www.bat-editions.net/%E2%88%86%E2%85%84%E2%8E%88.html" title="∆⅄⎈">∆⅄⎈</a>. But having a paper magazine is also difficult when you want to have your texts out there. Distribution is expensive and time consuming. In addition, funding bodies are now more eager to finance on-line publishing experiments than they are eager to finance print publishing.
    
<p>So BAT has switched to an online platform <a href="http://f-u-t-u-r-e.org/" title="&lt;o&gt; future &lt;o&gt;">&lt;o&gt; future &lt;o&gt;</a> (they somehow like ungoogleable names). On &lt;o&gt; future &lt;o&gt;, texts get published as soon as the copy-editing process is done. The site is a growing corpus of texts, that can be easily read and shared.</p>

<p>At the same time, BAT still makes paper publications—a difficult habit to shake off! But the position these publications take has changed in their output. The online platform here has become something of a starting point.</p>

<p>The publication <a href="http://f-u-t-u-r-e.org/r/C_The-Play_Play-1967-2014_EN.md" title="&lt;o&gt; future &lt;o&gt; → The Play, Big Book">The Play, Big Book</a> consists in part of facsimiles, collated in inDesign. But another part is <a href="http://f-u-t-u-r-e.org/r/06_Elodie_Royer_Yoann_Gourmel_The_Play_EN.md" title="&lt;o&gt; future &lt;o&gt; → Élodie Royer &amp; Yoann Gourmel, The Play">a text by Élodie Royer &amp; Yoann Gourmel</a>, that was already published on &lt;o&gt; future &lt;o&gt;. They layout of this text was done with CSS and HTML, using the website, and then integrated into the larger publication.</p>

<p>So BAT has made a shift: where there website was first mainly a vitrine for their print publications, it now has become a place where they publish directly, and even a tool that has become part of their print workflow.</p>

<p>Do you know more editors of print publications who have embraced the web?</p>

<p>AN ORGANISED CRIME GANG</p>
<p><a href="http://www.t-o-m-b-o-l-o.eu/" title="T-o-m-b-o-l-o">Tombolo</a> was initiated by Office ABC and Thierry Chancogne, French designers and teachers. It is a platform for critics and analysis of graphic design. A few years after started this online publication, together with other  graphic designers they launched <a href="http://presses.t-o-m-b-o-l-o.eu/" title="T-o-m-b-o-l-o presses">Tombolo presses</a>, a publishing house that releases some of their texts but also other books.</p>

My views are skewed, my history mine, but I can’t help but want to share how fascinating I find the world at the present moment. My internet history. My written history. Our history. This website is a history. This book is a history. One can be added to ad infinitum, the other is a more finite form. What new forms will our histories begin to take?" - Krystal South</a></p>

<p>Caitlin: On this website I really like the general style: <a href="http://averyreview.com" title="Avery Review">Avery Review</a>. But it doesn't really inspire me for my thesis design. What I would like there is more of a 2 layer design. Like you see in this website:  <a href="http://typographysummerschool.org" title="Typography Summerschool">Typography Summerschool</a>It has two layers in which you can scroll seperately.
